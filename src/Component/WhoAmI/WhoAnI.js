                        <p>I am a full-time WordPress web developer with over six years of experience. With over 300 projects completed, Iâ€™m not only proficient with WordPress but a wide range of other CMS and related technologies such as Wix, Joomla, Drupal, Shopify, Squarespace, Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Adobe XD
                            <br /><br />

                            In my career, I have designed and developed many websites from many niches. These projects have included extensive customization along with the addition of new features.
                            <br /><br />
                            Clear communication, honesty, and quick project turnaround are just a few things that are very important to me.</p>
